        <h3>Cautionary Traffic Signs</h3>
        <p>The goal of cautionary traffic signs is to warn drivers of any potential threat on the road ahead, like road work, potholes, and speed bumps. While these things are not inherent, accidents could occur if one doesnâ€™t slow down their vehicle. Hence, you must take cautionary road traffic signs as seriously as the mandatory ones.</p>
